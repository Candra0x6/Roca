  - Expected: Transaction reverts
- ✅ **Test**: Member leaving after pool lock
  - Expected: Transaction reverts with "CannotLeaveAfterLock" error

### 4. Member Management Features

#### 4.1 Member Leaving Before Lock
- ✅ **Test**: Member exits pool before it's locked
- ✅ **Process**:
  - Creator and member1 join pool
  - Member1 calls `leavePool()`
  - Full refund verification
  - Pool member count adjustment
- ✅ **Verification**:
  - Complete ETH refund (minus gas)
  - Pool state consistency
  - Member count reduction

### 5. Pool Factory Registry System

#### 5.1 Multi-Pool Creation & Tracking
- ✅ **Test**: Create multiple pools by same creator
- ✅ **Anti-spam Protection**: 
  - Time-based creation limits (1 hour minimum interval)
  - Test includes proper time advancement
